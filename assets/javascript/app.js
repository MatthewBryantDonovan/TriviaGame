//pseudocode
// game start start -> start button only
// screen will always display timer and all question data
// user selects answer
// display result
// click anywhere to continue
// iterate until all questions asked
// display final result data

//object oriented i will need a object named question
//it will need properties 
//ask
//option
//result (it will be the picture but I may add result flavor for win/loss/out of time in)
// (rPic, rWin, rLoss, rOOT)

// I will also need these vars
// wins
// loss
// OOT

* You'll create a trivia game that shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out.

* If the player selects the correct answer, show a screen congratulating them for choosing the right option. After a few seconds, display the next question -- do this without user input.

* The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.

  * If the player runs out of time, tell the player that time's up and display the correct answer. Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.
  * If the player chooses the wrong answer, tell the player they selected the wrong option and then display the correct answer. Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.

* On the final screen, show the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page).
